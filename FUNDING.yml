    # PayPal donation button is superior to a paypal.me link because it
    # additionally:
    #   - accepts credit cards without a need to create a PayPal account
    #   - allows monthly subscriptions (requires a PayPal account)
    # However, the URL is rather lengthy and GitHub shows it in full in the
    # Sponsor modal popup.

    # GitHub doesn't allow using URIs in FUNDING.yml, so instead of using a
    # Bitcoin URI we have to resort to using a blockchain explorer link.
    #
    # Blockstream has zero ads on its page, so let's use that, I guess. I have
    # to trust them not to redirect this page to someone else's wallet as a
    # person donating would likely copy the address off the Blockstream web page
    # rather than from the URL GitHub shows the user.

# At some point I should setup a static page with donation information and link
# to that instead of listing the donation methods here. That way I could hide
# the long PayPal link under a clickable PayPal donation button and use Bitcoin
# URI directly. I could put all of that into every README instead, and I
# actually might at some point, but the Sponsor button on GitHub stands out way
# more than a Donate section in a README, and it's easier to keep up to date -
# just replace a single file instead of having to manually edit every README, at
# least until I make a static page for donations that I link to in READMEs, then
# there would be no reason to edit them, so I decided not to touch READMEs until
# I have the static page setup.
